# Server Log Analysis Tool

## Project Description
In this assignment, I built a Python-based tool to analyze web server logs and extract key insights. The tool provides information such as request counts per IP, frequently accessed endpoints, and suspicious activity based on failed login attempts. It uses Python for parsing, analyzing, and summarizing log data, presenting results in the console and saving them as a CSV file.

## Features
- Analyze request counts for each IP address.
- Identify frequently accessed web endpoints.
- Detect and flag suspicious activities like failed login attempts.
- Display results in the console and save them to a CSV file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `csv` and `re` modules (built-in)
- Log file in a compatible format
